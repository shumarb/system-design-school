## Introduction
System Design is the process od designing a complex system to meet specific requirements and goals, typically aimed at providing a service to the end user.
To achieve this, various `technologies` & `components` are assembled to create a `cohesive` & `functional` system.

System Design focuses on these concepts:
1. Services: Components, applications, and APIs that provide specific functionality or processing capabilities. Services are created as `microservices` (`monolith`) to enable scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
2. Dataflow: Data flow within & between services is crucial to ensure efficient `processing`, `timely communication`, and `accurate` results. This involves understanding the `data formats`, `protocols`, and `communication` pattens between `services`.
3. Storage: `Databases`, `caches`, and `file systems` required to `store` and `manage` data throughout the system. This involves selecting appropriate storage technologies, data modeling, and ensuring data `consistency` & `durability`.
